# Kyle-Chat

This full stack application will allow users to sign in, add friends, and chat in real time with them. It uses the same stack as Kyle Reddit and I hope to build out it's features in a way that I can reuse in future applications.

## Todo

- user profiles that let you set your status and see who your friends are
-   user is able to add and remove other users to their list of friends using a unique id
-   ui to be able to see who your friends are, letting you click on them to open a chat box like discord
-   text editing that supports rich text
-   scalable send message flow with rate limit of 5 messages per second or something like that
-   upload images and files and display them in the chat

## Done

## Where to improve

-   emoji selector
-   use storybook and figma to work out the components so that the ui is nice
